## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/csa) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/csa) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.

Hi, my name is Edwin and I am currently a Junior at Del Norte High School and do have some experience in coding but nothing like this. I am very excited to do more projects like this, because it is fun

## Hobbies and Favorites

I have many hobbies such as playing video games, going outside with my friends, hiking, biking, and play some sports for fun such as badminton. I really like STEM and want a career in it in the future. I love to learn about the latest technology especially in automation and mobile phones.

My Favorite Food is Pizza and my Favorite Dessert are Brownies.

As mentioned earlier, I love to learn about the latest technology, including learning about the latest software updates on phones and seeing the features added. Did you know that Apple has allowed you to use your smartphone's cameras as your macbook's webcam, and it can even crop into your desk view!
