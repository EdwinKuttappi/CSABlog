# Taking the Multiple Choice Test
We were assigned a 40 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day.

## Question 7
**Topic**: 

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Incorrect. This statement creates a new Person object and assigns it to student. The new Person object and the current Person object are not the same object.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Correct. To change the private instance variable myName, a call to the mutator method setName needs to be made. This non-static method is called using the dot operator and the name of the object, which is student, and passes the name we want to update myName to as a parameter.

## Question 13
**Topic**:

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Incorrect. In the fourth iteration, k has the value 3, arr[3] is 3 which is greater than arr[4] which is 0, therefore 3 3 is printed. Since k will never be arr.length – 1, which is 5, the values of 5 10 will not be printed. There is no value subsequent to 10 to complete the comparison. 

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Correct. The for loop starts the loop control variable k with the value 0 and increments by 1 until k == arr.length - 1. In each iteration of the for loop, the element of arr at index k is compared with the element of arr at index k + 1. If the current value is greater than the next value, the current value of k followed by the element at index k is printed. Since the comparison is using the current value of k as an index as well as the subsequent value of k, the for loop must not iterate when k is the last index of arr (arr.length – 1). In the first iteration, k has the value 0, arr[0] is 7 which is greater than arr[1] which is 2, therefore 0 7 is printed. In the second iteration, k has the value 1, arr[1] is 2 which is not greater than arr[2] which is 5. Nothing is printed. In the third iteration, k has the value 2, arr[2] is 5 which is greater than arr[3] which is 3, therefore 2 5 is printed. In the fourth iteration, k has the value 3, arr[3] is 3 which is greater than arr[4] which is 0, therefore 3 3 is printed.  In the fifth iteration k has the value 4, arr[4] is 0 which is not greater than arr[5] which is 10. Nothing is printed. The value of k is incremented and has a value of 5, which is equal to arr.length – 1 and the loop terminates.

## Question 33
**Topic**:

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Incorrect. This would be correct if k was incremented by 1 during each iteration of the loop and the loop condition was changed to (sum < 12). Since k is never incremented, the or (||)  will always be true since k will always be less than 4 and an infinite loop will occur.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Correct. Since k is never changed in the body of the while loop, it will always be 1 and less than 4. In a boolean expression with or (||) if one of the two expressions is true, the expression is true. This will cause an infinite loop.

## Question 34
**Topic**:

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Incorrect. Choice III uses the default Point constructor to assign center a new Point with x and y both equal to 0. It attempts to update x and y, however since they are private instance variables in Point, they are not able to be accessed directly in Circle. This code will cause a compile time error.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Correct. Choice I uses the no parameter Point constructor to assign center a new Point with x and y both equal to 0, instead of x assigned the value a and y assigned the value b. Choice II correctly uses the two parameter Point constructor to create a new Point with x assigned the value a and y assigned the value b. Choice III uses the no parameter Point constructor to assign center a new Point with x and y both equal to 0. It attempts to update x and y, however since they are private instance variables in Point, they are not able to be accessed directly in Circle. This code will cause a compile time error.

## Question 36
**Topic 3.5**: Boolean Expressions

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Incorrect. This statement creates a new Person object and assigns it to student. The new Person object and the current Person object are not the same object.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Correct. To change the private instance variable myName, a call to the mutator method setName needs to be made. This non-static method is called using the dot operator and the name of the object, which is student, and passes the name we want to update myName to as a parameter.

## Question 37
**Topic 3.5**: Boolean Expressions

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Incorrect. Choice I works. Choice III works also, as it will cause the while loop to iterate while x is less than 7. The variable x is assigned 1 to start and then incremented by 2. It will be assigned the values 1, 3, 5 and then 7. When x has the value 7, the loop will terminate. The output will be 1, 3, 5.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Correct. Choice I will cause the while loop to iterate while x is less than 6. The variable x is assigned 1 to start and then incremented by 2. It will be assigned the values 1, 3, 5 and then 7. When x has the value 7, the loop will terminate. The output will be 1 3 5. Choice II will cause the while loop to iterate as long as x is not equal to 6. The variable x is assigned 1 to start and then incremented by 2. It will be assigned 1, 3, 5, 7, ... and will cause an infinite loop as it will never equal 6. Choice III will cause the while loop to iterate while x is less than 7. The variable x is assigned 1 to start and then incremented by 2. It will be assigned the values 1, 3, 5 and then 7. When x has the value 7, the loop will terminate. The output will be 1, 3, 5.
