# Requirements for individual reviews

Be prepared to talk about the following...
- [] Blog showing your and key assets and projects
- [] College Board prep and assets
- [] Blog timebox / Key Issues and other organization showing how you know where you have been and where you are going
- [] GitHub commits for first half of the year
- [] Something you are passionate about in the upcoming project

## Key Assets and Projects
This the blog I will be using to showcase all requirements for this Week 18 Checkpoint for Indicators

I'll be only focusing on my work from APCSA, the first half, as I think it provides more relevant evidence of key indicators.

### Classroom Jukebox

This was the first project that we took on getting into the year, so I wanted to mention it. It doesn't work anymore because our backend isn't deployed and the API key expired, but we had a fully functional app in which you could add songs to a playlist for a classroom so that a playlist would be played according to the students' liking. This was a good project because it was something we could all work throughout the year and make a product that could be used at Del Norte and other PUSD Schools.

[Classroom Jukebox](classroomjukebox.com) to see the demo as of now.

### Sorting Mini Project

This was the first mini project of the year and it was one of the most interesting projects that we had and it eventually became our inspiration for our 2 trimester project. It was very interesting and it was absolutely the most complicated one I've done so far. I was the frontend developer and I tried to make the UI look more cooler.

Our backend is not deployed, but [our frontend](https://sortingminiproject.github.io/frontend/) was where most of my work went. I tried to learn what Yuri was doing in the backend with his methods for each sorting and how it was accessed on the frontend. I see a repeat of APCSP where I didn't learn flask completely until second trimester and I could do it by myself. I hope that I can learn Spring soon and use it by myself since Java is so big.

## College Board Quizzes/Tests and Prep

I wanted to use this section to show my College Board quiz reflections and trimester 1 lesson grades, the latter of which being important because they're a reflection of my work toward understanding the specific lesson topics.

### CollegeBoard Study Guide
After the first CollegeBoard quiz, I started to make an APCSA AP Exam Study Guide that I can use, it's basically a master study guide that I can use for the AP Exam and make sure that I understand everything because I won't have ChatGPT to help me code. Here is the [Study Guide](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/2024/05/11/APExamStudyGuide_IPYNB_2_.html)

This is the blog that I plan to maintain in preparation for the AP Exam because I need to know more Java and I can refer to this to see the content from each lesson.

### College Board MCQ 1

[Link to Blog](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/2023/11/09/CSAQuiz1.html)
Score: 31/40

This was the first CollegeBoard MCQ that I did not do so well on because I was not able to do so well and I got a lot of help with a lot of the questions, even ones that I did not completely understand.

### College Board MCQ 2

[Link to Blog](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/2023/12/21/CB-MCQ-2_IPYNB_2_.html)
Score: 31/39

This is the second CollegeBoard MCQ that we did, and I took a lot more time on this quiz because I wanted to work on this more and understand the concepts. There were questions I spent over 10 minutes on because I was writing it in VSCode and testing it to find the right option.

### Tri 1 Lesson Grades

This is what I used to show off my Lesson Grades. This [Review Ticket](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi/CSABlog/issues/5) contains all of my grades for each Unit's hacks and shows my understanding and mastery of the concept to some extent. All Unit 1-10 Blogs can be found in my Timebox.

### Tri 2 Lesson Grades

This is what I used to show off my Lesson Grades. This [Review Ticket](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi/CSABlog/issues/8) contains all of my grades for each Lesson's hacks and shows my understanding and mastery of the concept to some extent. All Lesson Blogs can be seen in my Timebox below.

## Organization
This section will show how I organized my timebox and how I was able to show off what I did for each lesson and how my github-pages site was maintained.

### Timebox

I recently moved my work over from the original GitHub Pages template to Teacher 2.0, which is the blog you're seeing now and I transferred all the data into it so that my timebox is updated.

This is my [timebox](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/csa) for my work earlier in the year.

On the timebox, I try to make sure that I have a Goals/Plans blog for each week that we are in so that I can refer to it towards the end of the week to see how much progress I made

### Issues and Scrum Boards

One thing I think I've improved at a lot since the beginning of the year is creating review tickets and organizing Scrum Boards for projects.

My [Classroom Jukebox](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3) team made sure that we used Scrum Boards and made notes from each stand-up meeting that we had. I tried to recreate what I did in Trimester 3 of APCSP in which we were very organized. We also used issues to document changes and make sure that we did everything that we needed and updated it on the scrum board. I was mostly responsible for [the frontend](https://classroomjukebox.com) and the [search page](classroomjukebox.com/search).

For this two trimester project, I want to make sure we are organized and use a scrum table in which we update the status of each item that we have in the table so that we can make sure that it looks cool.

## Github Commits

[Here's my profile](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi?tab=overview) so you can see for yourself, but I have been consistently making commits throughout the year on multiple repositories. However, this is the area that I want to improve on the most. I make a lot of commits, but I feel that those commits are largely frontend or to my blog, I want to start committing more to the backend with the help of Yuri.

### My Favorite Commits

Here are a couple commits to go over:
- [Changed Search Look](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/cj_frontend/commit/2e24544ca8688e9c83ec17350e60a4a18ae49e53)
- [Big sorting algorithm commit](https://github.com/drewreed2005/PalettePuzzleBE/commit/b33c247a9dc57840dd4e3dd430aa2a73ea3d31fc)

## What am I Passionate About?

In this upcoming project, I want to push myself like I did in the trimester 1 project. I want to make something that requires some deeper research and knowedge to make efficiently, but also something that is general enough in function and purpose that people around our school can make use of it.

My group is set on making a teacher/student resources website specifically for Del Norte, with an emphasis on computer science and STEM. Some of the things we talked about incorporating would potentially require me to gain some new knowledge from others who have more experience, such as the idea to make a built-in Kahoot-like system where teachers can more easily assign a live quiz to their classes. Toby suggested that we use websockets for it, and AJ approved the idea, so we might do some work on that part of the website.

I think the fact that I'll be working on a website that may have a discernable impact on our school community (if marketed correctly) will be extremely motivating for me, as I mentioned in the creativity issue we made earlier this week.
