# Requirements for individual reviews

Be prepared to talk about the following...
- [] Blog showing your and key assets and projects
- [] College Board prep and assets
- [] Blog timebox / Key Issues and other organization showing how you know where you have been and where you are going
- [] GitHub commits for first half of the year
- [] Something you are passionate about in the upcoming project

## Key Assets and Projects
This the blog I will be using to showcase all requirements for this Week 18 Checkpoint for Indicators
I'll be only focusing on my work from APCSA, the first half, as I think it provides more relevant evidence of key indicators.

### Classroom Jukebox

This was the first project that we took on getting into the year, so I wanted to mention it. It doesn't work anymore (the API key expired), but we had a fully functional game in which you would try to guess which movie, between two movies, had a higher IMDb score. We even had a game currency system that would let the user customize their mouse. I think it shows some initial passion for making interesting, unique things early on in the year.

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2//2023/09/08/Styling_Movies.html) to see half-working demo.

### Sorting Mini Project

This was the first main project of the year and absolutely the most complicated one I've taken on so far. I was primarily the backend developer, so I worked fairly closely with the Dijktra algorithm code while primarily focusing on the user login system.

Our backend is no longer deployed, but [this page](https://csa-tri-1.github.io/DADDiJkstra-frontend/pages/signin) was where most of my work went (at least from the backend). I showed a good commit related to the project later in this blog, but I wanted to say that working on the login system was absolutely critical to me learning how to use Java in the backend, especially when it came to using JWT and Spring Security. I had a lot of problems with data staying persistent or breaking the database when they were deleted (due to a bad workaround I found for passwords not being encrypted with certain creation methods), but I was able to fix them all before the project was due to be finished.

## College Board Quizzes/Tests and Prep

I wanted to use this section to show my College Board quiz reflections and trimester 1 lesson grades, the latter of which being important because they're a reflection of my work toward understanding the specific lesson topics.

### College Board MCQ 1

[Link to Blog](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/2023/11/09/CSAQuiz1.html)
Score: 31/40

This was the first CollegeBoard MCQ that I did not do so well on because I was not able to do so well and I got a lot of help with a lot of the questions, even ones that I did not completely understand.

### College Board MCQ 2

[Link to Blog](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/2023/12/21/CB-MCQ-2_IPYNB_2_.html)
Score: 31/39

This is the second CollegeBoard MCQ that we did, and I took a lot more time on this quiz because I wanted to work on this more and understand the concepts. There were questions I spent over 10 minutes on because I was writing it in VSCode and testing it to find the right option.

### AP Exam Study Guide

[Link to Blog](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/CSABlog/2024/05/11/APExamStudyGuide.html)

This is the blog that I plan to maintain in preparation for the AP Exam because I need to know more Java and I can refer to this to see the content from each lesson.

### Tri 1 Lesson Grades

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2//2023/11/03/Student_Scores_Tri_1.html) for the blog with lesson grades. All lesson blogs individually are in my old blog's timebox. The most recent lessons are also relevant, but we just went over that.

## Organization

### Timebox

I recently moved my work over from the original GitHub Pages template to Teacher 2.0, which is the blog you're seeing now. I'm going to style it soon, I promise. As a result of the move, most of my timebox from the rest of the year is found on my old site, not this one.

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2/csa) for the majority of my work earlier in the year.

[Click here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/dre2.0/AA_csa.html) for my most recent work organized in a timebox. Because the move was so recent, I only really have blogs from the most recent student lessons.

### Issues and Scrum Boards

One thing I think I've improved at a lot since the beginning of the year is creating review tickets and organizing Scrum Boards for projects.

My [DADDiJkstra](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3) Scrum Board was set up by David, who helped me a lot with understanding useful tools like milestones and issue flags, but I contributed a lot to it. I was mostly responsible for [planning the demonstration video](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3?pane=issue&itemId=40188539) and the [qualification review ticket](https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3?pane=issue&itemId=43409888).

I was entirely responsible for the [mini-project Scrum Board](https://github.com/orgs/MADradium/projects/1/views/1?layout=board), but this is one I think I could have improved upon greatly. While the individual issues that were created made sense, I didn't do a good job enforcing that things should be added to the issue (replies and edits) to show progress, so most stayed the same as they were when they were first created. I did make edits to the [backend issue](https://github.com/orgs/MADradium/projects/1/views/1?layout=board&pane=issue&itemId=44754377) and I think I did a great job with all of the ticket issues (see rightmost section), but ultimately, I think it could have been organized and utilized better.

## Github Commits

[Here's a link to my profile](https://github.com/drewreed2005?tab=overview&from=2023-12-01&to=2023-12-31) so you can see for yourself, but I have been consistently making commits throughout the year on various repositories. However, this is the area that I want to improve on the most. I make a small number of very large commits, rather than splitting them up into smaller commits, even though I know not to do that. I'm going to work on improving on that as we approach the end of the school year.

- [Big sorting algorithm commit](https://github.com/drewreed2005/PalettePuzzleBE/commit/b33c247a9dc57840dd4e3dd430aa2a73ea3d31fc)

## What am I Passionate About?

In this upcoming project, I want to push myself like I did in the trimester 1 project. I want to make something that requires some deeper research and knowedge to make efficiently, but also something that is general enough in function and purpose that people around our school can make use of it.

My group is set on making a teacher/student resources website specifically for Del Norte, with an emphasis on computer science and STEM. Some of the things we talked about incorporating would potentially require me to gain some new knowledge from others who have more experience, such as the idea to make a built-in Kahoot-like system where teachers can more easily assign a live quiz to their classes. Toby suggested that we use websockets for it, and AJ approved the idea, so we might do some work on that part of the website.

I think the fact that I'll be working on a website that may have a discernable impact on our school community (if marketed correctly) will be extremely motivating for me, as I mentioned in the creativity issue we made earlier this week.
