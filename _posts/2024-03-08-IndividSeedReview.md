# 1.65-2.4/3.0 Seed
Very few students end up in this category.  Seed is intended to handle all issues at the lowest level, between Teacher and Student.  Office Hours and after School may be used to recover Seed.  However, Seed recovery can be a slow process.  For instance, a single classroom miss may require double the time for equitable makeup.
- Individual work.  Someone that is missing or incomplete on any of the Seed items in 90% category.
     - N/A
- Missing class.  Someone that is missing instruction or lab time and is not making it up (e.g. bathroom, tardy, field trips, sports, etc).
     - Not Applicable
- Incomplete team or individual work.  Someone that complains about circumstance that make it impossible to complete tasks, without recognition that they are not at least partially at fault.
     - Not Applicable
- Distracting from class/workplace.  Students are expected to be on task and available for communication at all times in classroom, after 5 minutes of classroom settling.  There are enumerable issues that can distract, e.g. doing other classroom homework (books, paper), headphone/ear pod usage, phone usage, foul language, inappropriate messaging, etc.
     - Not Applicable
- Unknown. Teacher often only knows a violation by observance.  Trying to compile a list is impossible.  If student want to perform and activity that is outside of normal classroom protocol they should simply ask.  
     - N/A
