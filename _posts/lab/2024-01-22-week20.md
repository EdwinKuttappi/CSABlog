# Goals
- Finally learn how to use RapidAPI
- Actually implement the use of API and make an actual frontend that gathers the element by their id
- Work with Toby on understanding the Search from the DataTest API and how it works
- Work with Vinay on trying to fix the Binary and DataTest API, and why it won't show

# Plans
- Make a working frontend demo of the Spotify API I tried to do last year, but get it to show on github-pages
- Watch a video to refresh on the API and how to use it
- Research another API that is external of RapidAPI like Justin's Pokemon API related to music or can contribute to Classroom Jukebox
- Make change from ChatGPT based on the feedback given from the API
- Learn how Yuri's JWT Tokens works

# Challenges
- Was not able to upload the JWT Authorization Key to access github-pages on our repository, but it worked with W3SChools and my other frontend website from last year. I tried changing some of the tags and it still did not work
