# Goals
- Pay attention in all the lessons and utilize it
- Actually implement the use of API and make an actual frontend that gathers the element by their id
- Work with Toby on understanding the Search from the Spotify API and how it works
- Work with Ishi on trying to fix the Spotify API, and why it won't show

# Plans
- Fixate on the 2 week mini project with sorting
- Learn how to use the backend with Yuri and contribute a sorting sequence to it
- Research another API that is external of RapidAPI like Justin's Pokemon API
- Make change from ChatGPT based on the feedback given from the API
- Learn how Aditya's JWT Tokens works

# Challenges
- Spring Framework was hard to learn and there was a lot that I needed to know to create a controller and everything else
- Was not able to upload the Spotify Authorization Key to access github-pages on our repository, but it worked with W3SChools and my other frontend website from last year. I tried changing some of the tags and it still did not work
