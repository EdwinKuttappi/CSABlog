# Week 15
This week was definitely very hard and I had no idea what I was doing. I think this was just because it was tool setup, and I remember last year that tool setup was one of the hardest things we did last year. I remember having to do a lot during that time to make sure that I did something. There was also a lot of lessons that I was working on that were all really good and it helped me to learn some more Java.

# Tools
I used github-pages with my frontend and AWS for our backend or localhost so that we could show our sorting mini project, and also our group kind of got switched as I am now with Vinay and Yuri

I was also glad that this year we were integrating Makefile again because I was not a big fan of the Gemfile because I had so many problems with that.
