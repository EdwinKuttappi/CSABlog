# Week 10
This week was definitely very hard and I had no idea what I was doing. I think this was just because it was tool setup, and I remember last year that tool setup was one of the hardest things we did last year. I remember having to do a lot during that time to make sure that I did something. 

# Tools
I was glad to hear that Anaconda was being deprecated for this year, because it was a tool that I was not looking forward to working with a lot and it caused a lot of problems

I was also glad that this year we were integrating Makefile again because I was not a big fan of the Gemfile because I had so many problems with that.
