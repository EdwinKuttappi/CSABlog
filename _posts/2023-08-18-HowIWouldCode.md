# Video Notes
In the future, I plan on taking AP Computer Science A during my senior year, which is next year. I also do plan on continuing Computer Science during college just to learn more about it. Right now I am currently trying to make a presentable website completely from scratch without using a Jekyll Template or anything like that. I also really want to complete the Harvard CS50 Course over the summer. There are a lot of things I want to do with Computer Science, and I want to be proficient in Python, JavaScript, Java, and possibly C# or C++. I am also in Coding4Kidz where I can teach younger kids about JavaScript, Python, or Scratch. Recently, James has also asked me if I want to join him in teaching coding to younger kids by making a bot for Discord and get them excited for coding.


# Reflection
Overall, I have learned a lot about Computer Science and obtained a numerous amount of skills from this class. I do highly recommend this class to everyone who is considering a STEM career even if their job will not require any Computer Science. Computer Science is just one of those things that people can learn to make their lives significantly easier, and by taking this class it can help people to learn a lot of technical skills and feel more comfortable with their computer. Even if they don’t need too much technical skills, AP Computer Science is a class that really challenges one’s general skills such as collaboration.
