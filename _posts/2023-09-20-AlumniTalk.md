# Take-Aways
It was nice to see Mabel, Colin, and Anthony again from last year. I remember from last year that I resonated a lot with Colin because he goes to UCSD and he is majoring in Mechanical Engineering which was the major I wanted to do. I remember him talking about how APCSP and APCSA helped him with his exposure to agile and everything else. I didn't think that I would resonate with anyone else on the panel, but after today's I found that I resonated a little more with Mabel this time because her current major is Cognitive Science: Machine Learning and Neural Computation. This is the current major that I am looking into for UCSD, and my primary desired major is Mechanical Engineering. I think that Mabel was very helpful in helping me to finalize my majors for UCSD and it seems that Data Science or Cognitive Science both seem like good options. It was nice to see that Tristan got very invested into Computer Science. It is important to have some tangibles, or having things deployed, it is important that you have many different projects. I remember last year, Anthony highly reccommended doing a lot of LeetCode, and I did not really do any of it nor look at it, but I know how hard Java is, so maybe now I should sign up for LeetCode and do it.

Tristan's Cheat Codes:
- Vercel
- SvelteKit (Tried using for Group Project)

The Q&A was very informative, and I should remember the YouTube Channel HyperPlexed and maybe watch some videos sometimes. I think that I can try and get an internship after my senior year or even during the second half of my internship because I can use that on my resume and show excitement. I know that it is very hard in order to get into a good college. Afterwards, I spoke with Colin and Mabel about my major because I want Mechanical Engineering and Cognitive Science: Machine Learning and Neural Computation.
