    "\n",
    "Explanation for Correct Answer: A, For the expression to evaluate to true, the expressions on either side of the && operator must be true. If x is true then x || y is true regardless of the value of y, meaning (x || y) && x evaluates to true. If x is false, the expression evaluates to false regardless of the value of (x || y)."

    "\n",
    "Explanation for Correct Answer: E, The call Math.random() will produce a double between 0 and 1, not including 1. To generate a random number in the range of 1 to 6, the call Math.random() needs to be multiplied by the number of integers you want to generate, in this case 6, giving us Math.random() * 6. This will result in a double between 0 and 6, not including 6. If we type cast this to an int, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6), the result will be an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. Adding 1 will adjust the range to 1 to 6 inclusive, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1. This expression will simulate the rolling of one number cube. Since each roll is independent, to simulate rolling two number cubes, we need to use this expression twice which simplifies to 2 + (int)(Math.random() * 6) + (int)(Math.random() * 6)."

    "Explanation for Wrong Answer: E, This would be the result if the code segment in the for loop was changed to numbers[k-1] = numbers[k-1] + 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation for Correct Answer: A, The values of the loop control variable k starts at 1 and is incremented by 3 as long as k is less than numbers.length. As a result, k will have the values 1, 4, 7 and then when it becomes 10, the loop will end. Only the values in numbers at indexes 1, 4, and 7 will be updated to the value of the sum of the element at the index that is one less than k (the element before the one being updated) and 3. So, numbers[1] will be assigned the value of numbers[0] + 3 or 20, numbers[4] will be assigned the value of numbers[3] + 3 or 45, and numbers[7] will be assigned the value of numbers[6] + 3 or 51. All other values will be unchanged."

    "Explanation for Correct Answer: E, Prior to the start of the nested for loops, the value of found is initialized to the element at row 0, column 0 in values and result is initialized to 0.The outer for loop iterates across all rows in values. The inner for loop iterates across the column indices of each row. When an element is located in the two-dimensional array that is larger than the current value stored in found, then this value is assigned to found and the column index is assigned to result. When the nested loop structure stops executing, the largest element in values is stored in found and the column in which that element was located is stored in result.\n"
