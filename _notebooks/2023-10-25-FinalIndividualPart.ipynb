    "- [New SASS Theme](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/cj_frontend/issues/5): Using this to scrub most of the CSS from the remote theme and fastpages and implement our own styles to make it look more like a professional app\n",
    "- [Custom Domain](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/cj_frontend/issues/7): To keep going with this professional app theme, we decided to get a custom domain rather than using aidenhuynh.github.io/cj_frontend and now we have classroomjukebox.com because it is a app that we want to be used by other teachers\n",
