    "In my opinion, this was the hardest FRQ out of the 4, and I really had no idea what was going on. I'm not sure if that is the general consensus, and if #3 was considered the hardest, but it was for me, this is a topic that I need to review before the exam, and possibly find questions similar to this one. For this question, I had to ask a lot of questions in order to help me fully understand what was going on. There was just so much initializing code, and once I understood that I tried to start part a, but it was hard. I referred to this Computer Science Professor who had done this problem and he helped me to understand what was really going and explained why he used the for loop.  **Also I think that after looking at the official Scoring Guidelines, their answer is much more complicated that what was done here, but I hope I would still get 3/3 for this**. I think that the key topic was about Arrays again and manipulating them, and this specific question was focused on manipulating different elements of the array. I think that this algorithm used relates to the FRQ because it shows us how we can access different elements of the list in order to find out how the problem can be solved.\n",
