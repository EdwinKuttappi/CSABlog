    "This question was very hard and I needed some help just like number 3, it was definitely not as easy as the first part. I think that this question, specifically part was easier thatn it looked, but there were a lot of other parts that needed some change because I had no idea what exactly what I needed to implement within the code cell. This is about classes and learning how to use classes and manipulate control structures. This problem wasn't as hard as question number 3, but I also had no idea how to attempt parts b and c, so I turned to raunak for some help and he offered me some guidance. This was a part that I did on Sunday night along with FRQ 3 because I didn't understand when I did them all on Saturday\n",
