    "This question was very hard and I needed some help, it was definitely not as easy as the first part. I think that this question is about classes and learning how to use classes and manipulate strings. I think the key algorithm during this part was focused on choosing the string 'HARPS' and then checking a series of hints in order to see how it works exactly. I also really liked this FRQ, and I was just thinking wouldn't it be cool if you could play in the terminal, and it just kind of happened with a lot of help, because I didn't know how to use Scanner all to well.\n",

    "The FRQs about 2D arrays and programming structures were tough. I couldn't solve them alone and had to use outside help to finish them. My struggle wasn't with writing the basic parts but putting everything together into a working program. I need to practice working faster, understanding 2D arrays better, creating complex structures, and knowing when to use string to array conversions.\n",

    "It's clear that the FRQ concepts are important for our project too. In the next trimester, I'll keep comparing our project work to practice FRQs. This way, I can understand the concepts better and see their relevance. It'll prepare me for the AP exam and future programming challenges."
